#### Notes
- I am still fairly new to macOS kernel development, this software project was initally a hobby project to get some reading on my newly built AMD hackintosh computer.

- With that being said, please bear with some of the spaghetti and not-idiomatic codes. Any criticism is much welcomed :)
