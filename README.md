AMD Processor power management and system monitoring plugin for [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC).


Please note that this release is at very initial stage of development, make sure you have a proper backup of your EFI folder and never run on any system that matters. 


### Now with AMD Power Tool

## Passive Power Mangagement
This options serves as a temporary solution to CPU power management due to no active solution are currently available. Comparing to a true active power managment implementation, this option works in a passive way which results in less sensitivity, accuracy and a slow down in performance.

I have been exploring possibilities for implementing a real active power management solution for AMD 17h platform. From what it looks like currently it is definitly possible. I will keep updating here with my latest progress.

## Credits
* [necross2](https://github.com/necross2) for adding support to temperature sensor offset.

## Notes
* I am still fairly new to macOS kernel development, this software project was initally a hobby project to get some reading on my newly built AMD hackintosh computer.

* With that being said, please bear with some of the spaghetti and not-idiomatic codes. Any criticism is much welcomed :)
